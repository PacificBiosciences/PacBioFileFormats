PacBio bioinformatics file formats
==================================

As of the 3.0 release of SMRTanalysis, PacBio is embracing the
industry standard BAM format for (both aligned and unaligned) basecall
data files. We have also formulated a BAM companion file format
(`bam.pbi`) enabling fast access to a richer set of per-read
information as well as compatibility for software built around the
legacy `cmp.h5` format.


.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   Primer
   BAM
   PacBioBamIndex
   FASTA
   DataSet
   RunDesignCsv


Legacy formats
==============


.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   legacy/BasH5Spec
   legacy/CmpH5Spec


APIs available
==============

We occasionally make changes to these file format specifications so we
recommend using PacBio-authored APIs to access these file types.

- C++: pbbam_
- Python: pbcore_


Data Model XSD

For completeness, here is the PacBio data model XSD.
